## Object-Oriented Design Principle

#### Single Responsibility
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.

#### Open Closed Principle
Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

#### Liskov Substitution
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program.

#### Interface Segregation
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. Interfaces should be specific to the client's needs.

#### Dependency Inversion
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. 
Details should depend on abstractions.
